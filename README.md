# Dart JSON Parsing: Handling Non-Existent Keys

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart when parsing JSON responses: attempting to access a key that does not exist in the JSON data. This often leads to runtime exceptions and unexpected program behavior.

The `bug.dart` file showcases the problematic code. The `bugSolution.dart` file provides a corrected version that uses safer methods to access JSON data, preventing exceptions and improving code robustness.

## How to run

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `bug.dart` to see the exception. 
3. Run `bugSolution.dart` to see the solution.
